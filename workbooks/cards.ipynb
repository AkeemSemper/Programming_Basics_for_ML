    "Let's make a poker game, or at least part of it. Our goal will ultimately be to create a game of 5 card draw poker. For now, we'll try to create a deck of cards, and hands for the players that inherit from the deck. So, we should have 3 classes for this stage: Card, Deck, and Hand:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Card</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> A card is one individual card, made up of a Suit and a Rank (ace, two, three...queen, etc...)</li>\n",
    "    <li></li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Deck</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> A deck is made up of a bunch of cards. </li>\n",
    "    <li></li>\n",
    "    <li></li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Hand</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> The hand class inheirits from the deck class and represents a \"mini-deck\" of five cards (we're building a 5 card poker deck for now, later on we'll change this\n",
    "    up a bit to make this into a five_card_poker deck, and that'll allow us to make other decks that inheirit from the Deck class but make sense for different games).</li>\n",
    "    <li></li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Underneath the spot we have to make the classes, there is a bunch of stuff to test and see if it works is there. This testing is limited, we should try to create more to really test things here - if we are going to build this up into an actual game of poker (and we intend to), we should make sure that things work first, especially the edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> a full game of poker, especially the part of calculating who wins, is actually reasonably complex. That part isn't really critically important, if we make some error in the calculation of which three of a kind tie-breaker <i>actually</i> wins, it isn't a big deal. The important point is that we can create a deck that works - even if there's some tiny error in the exact logic. We can always fix that later In reality, game logic errors are something we'd notice in user testing, where we would be actually playing to make sure it works, and at some point we'd see that the wrong player won some hand, and we'd have to go back and fix it. This is a bit of agile thinking, right now we're in sprint number one. "

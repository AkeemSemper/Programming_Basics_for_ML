    "When we are creating new classes that define usefule new types of objects, pasting the code into code cells over and over is not a very elegant solution. Instead, we can put the code for our classes into a normal Python (.py) file, then import that just as we do with other libraries. If we do this, using the classes that we've created is basically the same as using Pandas Dataframes or Numpy Arrays. If the python file is in the same directory as our notebook we can just import it by file name, as we've done here. \n",

    "Above there are two import statements, the <i>import cards</i> that is commented out, and the <i>from cards import *</i> that is being used. These each do the same thing, but in slightly different ways. The first one imports the entire file, and we need to use the dot notation to access the classes and methods that we want. The second one imports everything from the file, directly as its own thing, so we don't need to use the dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first, we are importing \"cards\", so if we want to access something that is inside of cards, like Deck, we need to use dot notation of cards.Deck to get to it. We can say that cards is the item that is visible to us, and we need to use dot notation to get to anything inside of it. In the second we are importing each class inside of the cards file on its own, so we don't need to use dot notation to get to it. We can think of that * import like a for loop, it'll grab each class and method in the file and import it on its own. There's no difference in the result of these two, we just need to call functions differently depending on which we use. You can see the same thing with imports from public libraries, most notably with sklearn, there are examples of both types of imports in the documentation, tutorials, and examples.\n"

One thing that we need to get to do this is an input from the player, what do they want to do with their hand. We can accommodate this by adding a method to the player class that will ask them what they want to do, and then return that decision. In our testing we can setup dummy actions for our players to take, but in the long run the method we build can be modified to work in a real game. For example, if our method accepts a decision of bet/call/fold, the logic of what we need to do in our game is done - accepting that decision can come from other places, such as another \"real\" player, a gamepad, the internet, etc...

    "<li> It allows us easily do regression testing, or verify that we haven't broken something that was working before. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "In ours, I want to cover the key things we are trying to make. This won't be totally comprehensive, but it will be representative. Some of the steps that I think I want to test are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Creating a game. </li>\n",
    "<li> Creating players and ensuring their names and banks work properly. </li>\n",

    "<li> Starting a new round from the ending state of the last one. (Our game keeps going, we shouldn't reset things like bankrolls). </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",

If all of this stuff works, we are likely good, up to the point that we are aiming for. As well, if something breaks as we make changes, we will notice that quickly, not after we've made dozens of other changes that can make it hard to find the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set this up, I can think of what steps are needed to do the work above, then code that. I can also think of what the output should be, and we can write checks to see if it matches the expected output. The checking part is obviously something that might not always be practical to do, but if it is possible it is something that can help us automate the testing process as much as possible. So the steps that I'll aim for are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Make a new game with some named players and a provided bankroll. </li>\n",
    "<li> Check that the players have the right names and bankrolls. </li>\n",

    "<li> Check that the players have the right cards.* </li>\n",
    "<li> Provide bets for the players. </li>\n",
    "<li> Determine winners. </li>\n",
    "<li> Change bankrolls. </li>\n",
    "<li> Check that the bankrolls are correct. </li>\n",
    "<li> Start a new round. </li>\n",
    "<li> Check inital bankrolls. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "This might change a bit as I go, but this is a good starting point. One thing to note is that we want to check the logic of who wins, and ensure that is correct so that we can test the bankrolls. For this test, I think that I might make the hands that each player gets be fixed, so we can know who should win. This will make it easier to test the new stuff, since we are already pretty confident that dealing different hands is ok from the testing we did outside the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do the actual tests in any way that we find convenient, one way is to use the assert statement. This statement will check if something is true, and if it is not, it will throw an error. This is a good way to check things that we expect to be true, and if they are not, we know that something is wrong. Using asserts can also integrate well with other testing and debugging frameworks, so it is good practice. There are several more elaborate testing frameworks that are more common in larger projects, but the idea is always the same - check and see if whatever we wrote passes whatever requirements we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Changes for Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "As we build this we will likely encounter changes we need to make, even to the older parts of the code. Most notably, we may need some changes to get values from objects so we can do the testing. We'll probably also notice things that we need to add, such as the ability to add names to players in our game. That's normal to find, and we can make the changes as we go for smaller things. Some of the things we add might not be useful for \"real\" poker games, they might just be needed for us to test; that is fine, we can just not use them later. "

Like most other things, what exactly we want to test for might grow or change as we build things and explore the details of our project more. For each one we want to check the functionality of the player class, so that will generally translate into:\n",

If we are able to capture all possible cases, we can be near certain that our code works properly if it passes. If we are not able to capture every possible scenario, but are able to capture many or a representative sample, we can't be certain but we can be more confident.

    "<li> Can we make the game to its initial state? With players and bankrolls? </li>\n",

If we compare them to a list for things like this, they are much easier to use. Rather than having to look through each item to see if the item we want is there, we can just ask for it by name and the dictionary will find it for us. In general, if we have a bunch of attributes that we want to associate with a single object, we can sensibly use a dictionary to store them."

This means that we can loop through its items using a for list, without having to really adapt our loop at all. This is one strength of the way things are designed as iterables in Python, we can create a function that loops through our data in a list, then use that same function on data that is stored in a dictionary, or a set, or any other iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> this is also one example of something we commonly see in the syntax of Python, multiple return values. In this case, the for loop is returning two values, the key and the value. This is something that is common, a function can return more than one value, and we can \"take\" as many of those return values as we need. Commonly the \"main\" value is the first, and others follow. If we don't need them, we just leave them out. This is also an example where some simple design choices that we make can have positive or negative unintended impacts. By utilizing the common interface provided by the iterable data structures, our code can be more flexible and more easily reused."
